# RAG and LangChain

This repository uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method along with the LangChain library to answer questions about George Orwell's books. The two books used in this implementation were sourced from [Project Gutenberg Australia](https://gutenberg.net.au).

This project was implemented by following the steps in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I&t=362s).
